#  PROJECT DETAILS:
This ia a Sales & order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier, including information on 
customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees.

#  PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
As a Business Intelligence Developer for Northwind Traders, a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet 
food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world. As part of my role, 
I have been tasked with building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team. 
Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:
‚Ä¢ Sales trends
‚Ä¢ Product performance
‚Ä¢ Key customers
‚Ä¢ Shipping costs
The dashboard should be built to evolve and accommodate new data over time, but I have also been encouraged by your manager 
to have insights & recommendations ready to share with the VPs. This is my chance to impress!

# INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Since reduction in sales made directly affects the amount of revenue generated across months, customers, products and employees 
the following should be taken into consideration to increase sales in significant areas:

 üöö   Enhance Order Processing Efficiency for Swift Delivery: Currently, the order shipment process takes an average of 8 days,
 which is notably slow. By optimizing the order processing     system, we can achieve expedited deliveries, resulting in heightened customer satisfaction,
 stronger loyalty, and favorable reviews.

üéØ    Prioritize the Retention of High-Value Clients: Certain customers have made substantial contributions to our revenue.
Therefore, it is prudent to intensify our initiatives aimed at retaining these valuable patrons, 
while also providing them with incentives to foster ongoing business relationships with the company.

 üåç   Direct Marketing Resources to USA and Germany: Analysis has highlighted these nations as our top-performing markets, 
 indicating a strong sales potential. To capitalize on this opportunity, it is advisable for the company to invest a greater share of its marketing
 efforts in these regions, thereby stimulating sales growth.

üéØ    Products like C√¥te de Blaye, Raclette Courdavault, and Th√ºringer Rostbratwurst warrant increased attention in terms of production and stocking. 
This is because they have demonstrated the highest revenue generation among all other products.

üö¢    While Federal Shipping and United Package generated the highest revenue, it's evident that their freight costs are notably higher. 
Additionally, they handled a larger volume of shipments compared to Speedy Express, which has more economical freight charges. As a result,
it's recommended to decrease reliance on Federal Shipping and United Package due to their relatively expensive freight costs.

üöÄ    Boosting Employee Sales Performance: To further motivate top-performing employees who excel in generating sales,
the implementation of incentive packages can be introduced. This approach not only encourages these individuals to achieve
even more but also inspires others to elevate their performance.
